// Step 3 From the __START-HERE-SQLi-demo-instructions.txt File:

// NOTE: If you're using the Canvas activity on your own, the suggested answer in the first box under the Mount the Attack section is incorrect; the answer
// should be "We SHOULDN'T have been logged in!"

// YOUR GOAL AS A WHITE HAT HACKER (and to satisfy the Acceptance Criteria in the graded assignment)
// is to LOG IN AS IF YOU WERE THE ACTUAL USER! You know you're goal has been reached when you enter a malicious piece of 
// SQL code in the password field and be logged in even though you didn't use the user's actual password!

// 1: Read over the code below. To optimize your learning, spend at least 5 minutes of self-talk going through it. 
// Ask yourself "What is this code doing?" If you're not sure what the code is doing. Or if you're not sure how to describe what it's doing, 
// just copy the code and paste it in an AI VSCode extension such as Codeium or in an external tool such as ChatGPT, or you could pay for GH Copilot. 

// 2: Read over and follow all the comments in this file and then return to Step 4 in the __START-HERE-SQLi-demo-instructions.txt file 
// to perform the SQL injection attack.

	console.log("username: " + username);

	// Keep in mind that allowing a string to be passed directly into your database like this as a parameter in a route handler in real life (without 
	// proper precautions such as using a prepared statement, is NOT a good way to make SQL queries for production because it makes your app extremely vulnerable. It's only for coding in development mode, your own non-commercial portfolio projects, or for a demo like this. 
	
	// This is the exact input that will achieve the result when entered in the username field and the correct password is used: unknown' OR '1'='1

	// When you can log in successfully by entering these malicious characters instead of a valid password, you'll know your hack has been a success!

			// )
			res.send('Login successful')


			// NOTES:

			// 1. For the same effect, you can comment out the long "malicious attack code" in the db.get(query...) method call above and do Number 2
			// below to see the same effect. This code was just some hardcoded fun but is potentially confusing.

			// 2. Uncomment out res.send('Login successful') under it so that you can see the user log in successfully.

			// 3. If you run into any weird errors that pop up even if you've had the app run correctly before, try deleting the package-lock.json file and 
			// the node_modules folder and then running npm install again.
